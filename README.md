You know when you hover over a profile and want to see their header fast? No? Well now you do.

Remember those "how do I fit this into my header?" and you have to click your way onto the profile and stuff?
No more. Not with this small extension.

Probably adding more features soon, like blocking fast, etc. but not for now at least. This lightweight fella will do, for now.


Much love!
